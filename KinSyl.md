KinSyl &ndash; the aultum'shi syllabary
======

The KinSyl syllabaries vary by region of Quaehĩrrh. They are generally
a compromise between the native phonetic richness attainable by hnym
vocal cords, and the simplifications required for trade with nearby
species that can only approximate hnym pronunciation. The table below
gives the syllabary used by the elementary school in Hnym'olom, and by
mothers who use qurĩmshi'bip to teach their foals in the cradle.

Although part of Quaehĩrrh's interior, Hnym'olom has pretensions of
being a frontier town because of its proximity to the dangerous
{Rĩf'ishim} forest. Therefore, the local syllabary includes some
simplifying compromises (e.g. "hnym" -> "kinim") and exotic features
(the 'zu' row, introduced in honour of Zecora's willingness to settle
in {Rĩf'ishim} and share priceless Zebrician medical knowledge with
the local hnym).

This also made Hnym'olom a convenient setting for the
experimental-diplomatic {Tuer'Fĩm'Aurin} interspecies friendship
university.

(\*The 'h' consonant is distinguished into two variants: a hard-h that
may be assimilated to 'k' e.g. 'Hnym'->'Kinim', and a soft-h &ndash;
similar to the 'f' in 'Fukuoka' &ndash; that may be assimilated to
'f', e.g. 'Jehu'->'Yefu'.)

(\*\*For simplicity, the cloudy-i and -aau glyphs are only
demonstrated for the vowel row. They may be formed analogously for
subsequent consonant rows, e.g. 'kei'={ᑫᐤ}, 'raau'={ᕋᐤ/ᕌᐤ}.)

(\*\*\*From Zebrician, this glyph does not follow the standard
qurĩmshi'bip logic for rotation. The 'zi' glyph and long vowel
markings are missing, which is a hint to the nature of the zebras'
single-hĩrrh view of Ceremonial Time.)

Besides syllabic glyphs, the following punctuation glyphs are used:
| glyph   | purpose                                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ᐧ       | 'separator' conveys emphasis in agglutinated words         |
| &ndash; | 'long separator' e.g. ReWe&ndash;no'rim = ᙮ᕂ᙮ᔦ&ndash;ᓄᐧᕆᒻ  |
| ᙮       | 'proper noun' prefix e.g. TaiRim = ᙮ᑕᐃ᙮ᕇᒻ                  |
| . 。    | 'period' to mark end of sentence                           |
| ? ! ,   | not usual on Quaehĩrrh, but may be natural in Earth usage  |

It is my suspicion that KinSyl's overall design on Quaehĩrrh has been
tightly quantum-double-slit synchronized to the Canadian Syllabics
writing system. There are *two* [conflicting but valid sources][1] for
the development of Canadian Syllabics.

According to Europeans, the system was rationally co-designed by
Christian missionaries and First Nations. The missionaries wished to
respect local languages and print translated Christian texts with
minimal resources. The rotation of glyphs to indicate vowel valence
made it easy to achieve literacy and reduced the variety of typeset
blocks that needed to be manufactured.

But according to First Nations, the system was taught to
{ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ/Calling Badger} on a visit to the spirit-world, long before
missionaries arrived.
