KinSyl &ndash; the aultum'shi syllabary
======

The KinSyl syllabaries vary by region of Quaehĩrrh. They are generally
a compromise between the native phonetic richness attainable by hnym
vocal cords, and the simplifications required for trade with nearby
species that can only approximate hnym pronunciation. The table below
gives the syllabary used by the elementary school in Hnym'olom, and by
mothers who use qurĩmshi'bip to teach their foals in the cradle.

Although part of Quaehĩrrh's interior, Hnym'olom has pretensions of
being a frontier town because of its proximity to the dangerous
{Rĩf'ishim} forest. Therefore, the local syllabary includes some
simplifying compromises (e.g. "hnym" -> "kinim") and exotic features
(the 'zu' row, introduced in honour of Zecora's willingness to settle
in {Rĩf'ishim} and share priceless Zebrician medical knowledge with
the local hnym).

This also made Hnym'olom a convenient setting for the
experimental-diplomatic {Tuer'Fĩm'Aurin} interspecies friendship
university.

(\*The 'h' consonant is distinguished into two variants: a hard-h that
may be assimilated to 'k' e.g. 'Hnym'->'Kinim', and a soft-h &ndash;
similar to the 'f' in 'Fukuoka' &ndash; that may be assimilated to
'f', e.g. 'Jehu'->'Yefu'.)

(\*\*For simplicity, the cloudy-i and -aau glyphs are only
demonstrated for the vowel row. They may be formed analogously for
subsequent consonant rows, e.g. 'kei'={ᑫᐤ}, 'raau'={ᕋᐤ/ᕌᐤ}.)

(\*\*\*From Zebrician, this glyph does not follow the standard
qurĩmshi'bip logic for rotation. The 'zi' glyph and long vowel
markings are missing, which is a hint to the nature of the zebras'
single-hĩrrh view of Ceremonial Time.)

Besides syllabic glyphs, the following punctuation glyphs are used:
| glyph   | purpose                                                    |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ᐧ       | 'separator' conveys emphasis in agglutinated words         |
| &ndash; | 'long separator' e.g. ReWe&ndash;no'rim = ᙮ᕂ᙮ᔦ&ndash;ᓄᐧᕆᒻ  |
| ᙮       | 'proper noun' prefix e.g. TaiRim = ᙮ᑕᐃ᙮ᕇᒻ                  |
| . 。    | 'period' to mark end of sentence                           |
| ? ! ,   | not usual on Quaehĩrrh, but may be natural in Earth usage  |

It is my suspicion that KinSyl's overall design on Quaehĩrrh has been
tightly quantum-double-slit synchronized to the Canadian Syllabics
writing system. There are *two* [conflicting but valid sources][1] for
the development of Canadian Syllabics.

According to Europeans, the system was rationally co-designed by
Christian missionaries and First Nations. The missionaries wished to
respect local languages and print translated Christian texts with
minimal resources. The rotation of glyphs to indicate vowel valence
made it easy to achieve literacy and reduced the variety of typeset
blocks that needed to be manufactured.

But according to First Nations, the system was taught to
{ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ/Calling Badger} on a visit to the spirit-world, long before
missionaries arrived.

Preschool Literacy and Incarnational Gatekeeping
===

Foals in cradle being Anki-studying the KinSyl glyphs as their mother
rotates the qurĩmshi'bip, starting with the triangle, and sings: "ᐃI
.. ᐊA .. ᐁE .. ᐅO", trying to get the foal to sing along, and then to
sing in response to the cube without the mother's prompting. Other
symbols are gradually introduced: "ᐯBI .. ᐸBA .. ᐯBE .. ᐳBO" etc.,
repeated in SRS style, and the order of rotation is varied. Mothers
tend to display a natural instinct for 'spaced-repetition', sensing
when the foal is confused/excited/bored by the song. Later,
qurĩmshi'bip cubes are combined to form basic words.

Once foals at a mobile+speaking age understand what the dots mean,
they are considered eligible enough to enter Tei'lushi'lom, equivalent
to elementary/middle school. Older students may study for half-days.
The presence of older colts/fillies is essential for socializing the
younger foals, though this system has downsides in the establishment
of schoolyard hierarchies. Graduation requirements are flexible,
though usually a qatei'yoshi is considered necessary.

Further education is provided by various specialized Aurin, defined
very generally &ndash; e.g. Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns and
the Wonderbolts Academy are both Aurin, the ReYe&ndash;norim /
Equestrian Railways system operates its own engineering college, and
so forth. Aurin attendance does not necessarily follow immediately
after Tei'lushi'lom graduation, rather taking place when a hnym feels
the need to expand career opportunities.

Trance-augury data on vowel sequence suggests the following common
orderings, emerging from a fabric of semi-justified regional
superstition as to which combination of songs is optimal. It's worth
noting that there is a political shakeup in the works as
human-to-Quaehĩrrh incarnational reverence becomes more likely:

1. Hnym'olom, rather hasty: "ᐃI .. ᐅO .. ᐁE .. ᐊᐤAAU" &ndash;
   described in trance as a way to "keep that {sacred/scared} line
   scared enough to enforce!TenSha", possibly meaning that the
   unexpected vowel order discourages hasty/impatient incarnational
   reverence from Earth.

2. Hnym’olom, more thorough: "ᐃi ᐅo ᐁe ᐊᐤAU ᐊa ᐁe ᐆu ᐃi ᐅO" &ndash;
   described in trance as "infinite debug every letter voodoo",
   probably from the PoV of a reincarnated!human Tei. Any Tei patient
   enough to grind through this is likely to be well-integrated with
   hnym nature.

3. KinTaiLo{n/rm} hirin standard: "ᐊA .. ᐁE .. *different colour cube
   ᐆU* .. ᐃI .. ᐅO" &ndash; here, TenSha is discouraged unless the Tei
   has had a prior aultum enactment, but it may be vulnerable to
   English!hnym expecting to tune into a vowel sequence starting with
   ‘A’. This will probably become the subject of infinity
   passive-aggressive hĩrin tea-drinking discussions behind closed
   doors &ndash; unstoppable force of 'KinTarLom' gatekeeping meets
   immovable object of high-society hĩrin mothering superstitions.
   Fancy Pants, I feel your pain.

   Additional trance note: Hirin who can formulate new hĩrin’rin
   intonations need to have been {Alu!Tei/aultum/...}, or falling out
   into provincial hĩrin society is almost guaranteed. So the problem
   may be self-correcting, at least in my controversial reading of the
   metaphysics.

4. Projected HiE!foal &ndash; a reincarnated Tei will tune in more
   readily to varied "ᐊA .. ᐁE .. *flip ᐃI* .. ᐅO", allowing sneaky
   prediction of reincarnated-human developmental issues at the
   doctor’s.

Needless to say, the incarnational barriers under discussion are
specific to Tei from the English-speaking sphere where MLP:fĩm was
most popular. Politically and scientifically, I am not in a position
to confirm or deny that Quaehĩrrh's population may have boomed partly
in synchrony with... severely negative demographic trends for the
original inhabitants of Turtle Island. Such incarnational traffic
would, in fact, benefit other species of Rauulm as well as the hnym,
depending on the temperament of the transmigrating Tei.
