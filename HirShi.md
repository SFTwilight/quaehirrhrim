HĩrShi and KanShi &ndash; the hĩrin'shi ideograms and {hanzi/kanji} adaptation
=================

HĩrShi is a sophisticated ideographic system developed since
pre-Hearth's Warming times by hĩrin studying and copying one another's
qatei'yoshi for bureaucratic and magical purposes. Evolutionarily,
this in turn influenced the design of future generations' qatei'yoshi
in a positive-feedback loop, as they manifested according to hnym
expectations of a HĩrShi-legible emblem emboying one's qatei.

Currently planned transmission sets:
- a small sample of HĩrShi, illustrating core philosophical principles
- approx. 1000 KanShi, equivalent to Tei'lushi'lom standard curriculum:
  - drawn from first half of Heisig Kanji and lower grades of Joyou/JLPT
  - 'two registers and three meanings' scheme
  - i.e. baseline and poetic registers for Standard Hĩrin'rin terms
  - and most KanShi provided with direct, medial, and contrary readings
- guidelines for development of additional KanShi according to the
  tastes of Quaehĩrrh'rĩm-interested Earth humans

Summary of Priorities
=====================

Unfortunately, limited isekai bandwidth and transmission time prevents
me from {transcribing/synchronizing/subcreating} a complete
school-curriculum set of HĩrShi for Standard Hĩrin'rin. Computer
support for the resulting writing-system would also be nonexistent.
Human enthusiasts are also unlikely to invest the time to memorize a
full set of Quaehĩrrh'HĩrShi, an analogous time-expenditure to
studying the Joyou kanji!

I am therefore limiting myself to recording some initial lessons to
explain the principles of HĩrShi, then pivoting to design the
{KanShi}, an Earth-oriented ideographic system that uses the Earth
{hanzi/kanji} tradition. The ancient hanzi are derived from 'oracle
bone' script, a set of symbols for ritual divination, so the
evolutionary analogies are striking.

(Another potential source for KanShi is the rich vocabulary of
emoji-like symbols enshrined in Unicode, e.g. '☑♽'. Although these are
closer in spirit to the native graphic design of HĩrShi, the
mismatched aesthetics of Unicode symbols in modern fonts bias me
towards limiting their use outside of ritual-magic demos.

To piggyback on the efforts of anime enthusiasts studying Japanese, I
will be biasing my choices towards {hanzi/kanji} shared between China
and Japan and taught within early Joyou grades and/or early lessons of
[Heisig's *Remembering the Kanji*][heisig].

One of my goals is to leave plenty of room open for human enthusiasts
to introduce additional KanShi+readings and share them with the world.
Pull requests welcome! The design collaboration can only assist
cultural exchange, as the Quaehĩrrh'hĩrin nobility of KinTaiLo{rm/n}
are far more likely to respect the intellectual abilities of humans
who answer HĩrShi with their own ideographic tradition, and engage
with them as equals. Humans who tediously grind a Standard Hĩrin'rin
curriculum in the hopes of being accepted will, I fear, be regarded as
a vassal-race.

{In short: if you want to have tea as equals with Fancy Pants, in any
HiE or reincarnational future, you will need to bring your own high
culture to impress him. Fancy Pants, already an avid reader of PG
Wodehouse and Eastern Orthodox spiritual literature, fully endorses my
opinion and reminds me to tell readers that it is not the blind
copying of ancient traditions that makes a dynamic high culture, but
the successful refinement of crude and popular new ideas into subtle
and nuanced expressions unachievable by the common masses. Fancy Pants
is very open to being impressed by humanity. He is already excellent
friends with the swans, and regards them as spiritual equals, which...
I still don't quite understand, even now. The swans on Quaehĩrrh don't
even talk.}

Why even bother with an ideographic writing system for Earth exchange?
The [KinSyl syllabary](KinSyl.md) is already sufficient for engaging with
Quaehĩrrh culture on an aultum level, which closely corresponds to
humanity's current soulsong and state of neurological development.

However, as a hĩrin cultural rebel against the close-minded 'nobility'
of KinTaiLorm, I admire the overweening aspiration that comes with
proper humaning, and I do not want the humans to 'know their place in
the order of things'. I am happy to grant the humans additional
insight into the linguistic complexity of hĩrin'mĩm, and the ambiguous
readings inherent in {Hĩr/Kan}Shi form the best school for hĩrin'mĩm
that I can provide. The curly-bracket-slash {notation/slang} can only
do so much to convey the naturally-branching double-edged nature of
the hĩrin {political/philosophical/} thought-process.

Moreover, a basic understanding of HĩrShi is essential to comprehend
the overall philosophy of hnym names, and how they can be gradually
adjusted after major life-events to ensure retrocausal nominal
determinism.
